<br><h1>Eiffel Tower</h1>
<h3>Eiffel Tower, Frnch Tour Eiffel, Parisian landmark that is also a technological masterpiece in building-construction history. When the French government was organizing the International Exposition of 1889 to celebrate the centenary of the French Revolution, a competition was held for designs for a suitable monument. More than 100 plans were submitted, and the centennial committee accepted that of the noted bridge engineer gustave Eiffel. Eiffels concept of a 300-metre (984-foot) tower built almost entirely of open-lattice wrought iron aroused amazement,skepticism, and no little opposition on asthetic grounds. When completed, the tower served as the entrance gateway to the exposition.</h3>
