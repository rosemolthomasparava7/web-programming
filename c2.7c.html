<p><b>Aruthungal: </b>
St. Andrew’s Basilica at Arthunkal in the district of Alappuzha, is considered to be the largest shrine 
of Saint Sebastian in all of the world. Originally constructed by the Portuguese missionaries in the 16th century,
 the church was rebuilt in 1584 under the priest Jacomo Fenicio who was believed to possess powers to heal body and mind, and 
was popularly known as ‘Arthunkal Veluthachan’ translating to ‘fair-skinned father’.</p>

Champakulam Kalloorkadu Marth Maryam (St. Mary’s) Basilica, popularly known as St. Mary’s Forane Church is an
 ancient Syro- Malabar church in the Archeparchy of Changanacherry. Constructed in 427 AD, the church is one of 
the oldest Syrian Catholic churches in all of India. The brilliant architecture, elaborate rock inscriptions and ancient 
artefacts boast about the Portuguese influence in the traditional designs and are worth a visit. Legend has it that this 
church was the first to have been founded by St. Thomas, the apostle himself.
Situated in Champakullam, on the banks of river Pamba, the rich history, legacy and the 
ingenious architecture attracts a large number of tourists to the spot. The pearly white building is a wonderful 
amalgamation of Syrian and Portuguese designs. It is believed that this church was the reason of reconciliation 
between Catholics and Jacobian Syrians centuries ago; hence it is considered a rich heritage of Christianity in India.</p>
