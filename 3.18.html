<h1>Goa</h1>
India’s ‘sunshine state’ has long provided a haven for those in search of the sun, sand and sea. Boasting 105km of stunning coastline and an endless list of idyllic beach settings, there’s no surprise so many people flock to Goa for their beach holidays. The laid-back and picturesque state is all about relaxation, and in fact, the only stress you’re likely to encounter is in choosing which beach to visit during your holiday in Goa.
